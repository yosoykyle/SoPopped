# ⚙️ Technical Setup

## 🚀 Accessing the Project

1. Ensure **Apache** and **MySQL** are running in XAMPP.
2. Place the project folder `SoPopped` in `xampp/htdocs/`.
3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - **Customer Home**: [http://localhost/SoPopped/home.php](http://localhost/SoPopped/home.php)
   - **Admin Dashboard**: [http://localhost/SoPopped/admin/dashboard.php](http://localhost/SoPopped/admin/dashboard.php)

## 🗄️ Database Setup (Update or Create)

### Option 1: Existing Database (Migration)

If you already have an older version of the SoPopped database:

1. **Run migrations in order:**
   - First: Execute `db/1. RUN THIS add_user_carts_table.sql` in your MySQL Workbench or RDBMS
   - Second: Execute `db/2. RUN THIS ALTER TABLE users.sql` in your MySQL Workbench or RDBMS
   - Third: Execute `db/3. RUN THIS add_contact_archiving.sql` in your MySQL Workbench or RDBMS

2. **Update credentials:**
   - Edit `config.php` with your database credentials:
     ```php
     define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
     define('DB_NAME', 'sopopped');
     define('DB_USER', 'root');
     define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
     ```
   - Edit `db/sopoppedDB.php` (tests `config.php` automatically)

3. **A Must: Run seed files (recommended for development)**
   - After running the migrations above, you can populate sample data and an admin account:
     - Execute `db/manual_seed_sample_products.sql` in your MySQL Workbench or RDBMS — inserts sample products
     - `php db/seed_admin.php` — creates an admin user (`admin@admin.com` / `admin123`)
   - Example (VS Code Terminal):
     ```bash
     php db/seed_admin.php
     ```

### Option 2: Fresh Installation

If this is your first time setting up the database or want to start fresh:

1. **Import complete schema:**
   - Execute `db/USE THIS SCHEMA.sql` in your MySQL Workbench or RDBMS
   - This creates all tables with the latest structure

2. **Update credentials:**
   - Edit `config.php` with your database credentials:
     ```php
     define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
     define('DB_NAME', 'sopopped');
     define('DB_USER', 'root');
     define('DB_PASS', 'your_password');
     ```
   - Edit `db/sopoppedDB.php` (tests `config.php` automatically)

3. **A Must: Run seed files (recommended for development)**
   - After importing the full schema you may run the seeders to add sample products and an admin account:
     - Execute `db/manual_seed_sample_products.sql` in your MySQL Workbench or RDBMS
     - `php db/seed_admin.php`
   - Example (VS Code Terminal):
     ```bash
     php db/seed_admin.php
     ```
